            Taking inventory of his life <br />
            Seeing snapshots chronologically inline <br />
            Something told him he should look around and <br />
            tidy up He collected many things but never quite enough <br />
            Tried looking at it from a new perspective <br />
            Flat on his back but he still heard the directive <br />
            Orders from that corner where that shadow always lived <br />
            Never asked permissions he just hopes that they forgive <br />

            I don't want to go like this <br />
            At least let me clean my room <br />
            I don't want to leave like this <br />
            'Cause the last thing I want to do is <br />
            Make my people make decisions <br />
            Wondering what to do, oh <br />
            Should they keep it on display Or redecorate? <br />

            Blankets over mirrors, she tends to <br />
            like it She's not afraid of her reflection <br />
            But of what she might see behind it <br />
            She had plans to change her name, yeah <br />
            Just not the traditional way, yeah <br />
            Haunted by a couple big mistakes <br />
            She covers all the dents with the way she decorates <br />
            Then one night she got cold with no blankets on her bed <br />
            So she ripped them off the mirror, stepped back and she said <br />

            With the bells and the whistles scaled back <br />
            Like an isolated track <br />
            And he feels trapped when he's not inebriated <br />
            Fair to say he's fairly sedated most days of the week <br />
            He might have made it if he lived on a different street <br />
            I repeat, scaled back and isolated <br />
            He says he likes an open schedule but he mostly hates it <br />
            If you're running to his room, take a breath before you break-in
            <br />
            Put your ear up to the door, tell me can you hear him saying? <br />
